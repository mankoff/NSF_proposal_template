#+SETUPFILE: preamble.org


* Instructions							   :noexport:

From the [[GPG.pdf][GPG]]: ...there is no established page limitation for the references, this section must include bibliographic citations only and must not be used to provide parenthetical information outside of the 15-page Project Description.


+ References should be added to [[Library.bib]] in BibLaTeX format.
+ If you have other BibLaTeX files, you can add as many =\addbibresource{/path/to/file.bib}= lines as you want in [[preamble.org]].
+ References should be automatically generated in LaTeX anywhere you add a =\printbibliography= line.
+ If you are going to generate a DOC file, there are a few options:
  + Manually curate the list (Hint: inserting the =(Author(s), YYYY)= text into the Org document can still be done using RefTeX.)
  + Generate a PDF and then cut-and-paste the references into the DOC
  + Export a tex file from Org, and then use pandoc: =pandoc -f latex -t docx -o FILE.docx --bibliography ./FILE.bib FILE.tex=. Note that FILE.bib may crash pandoc if it is too large or contains certain characters. To get around this, create a local subset BibLaTeX file (see below).
+ If you want to generate a subset BibLaTeX file for this project from a master =bib= file, you can do so with one of the following commands. Presumable you've generated a LaTeX file with =cite=, =autocite=, or =nocite= commands based on a global file, then:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :cmdline -i :results verbatim :exports code
bibexport <file.aux>                           # if you have an aux file from bibtex
biber <texfile><.NOEXT> --output_format bibtex # if you use biblatex
#+END_SRC

And then you can update the document to use the local file rather than the global file.

* References

# \nocite{*}      <-- include *everything* in [[Library.bib]].
# nocite:CiteKey  <-- include something in the references but not in the document

\printbibliography[heading=none]
