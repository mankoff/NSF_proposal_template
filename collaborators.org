# A list of all persons in alphabetical order (including their current organizational affiliations) who are currently, or who have been collaborators or co-authors with the individual on a project, book, article, report, abstract or paper during the 48 months preceding the submission of the proposal. Also include those individuals who are currently or have been co-editors of a journal, compendium, or conference proceedings during the 24 months preceding the submission of the proposal. If there are no collaborators or co-editors to report, this should be so indicated.

* About This File 						   :noexport:

This is an Emacs Org file that is used to maintain a list of collaborators for NSF proposals. The file consists of 1. [[*Collaborators][a table]] of collaborators including name, affiliation, note about the collaboration, and date of collaboration, and 2. [[*Export%20Table%20(Code)][Code]] that generates a file, =collaborators.txt=, that is then included in the [[./bio.org]] file.


* Setup Buffer							   :noexport:

Time stamps in the table should be formatted YYYY-MM-DD. 
Press C-c C-c in the following code section to set this up.
